Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard project! This interactive dashboard allows users to explore the microbial diversity in human navels based on the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

## Introduction

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is built using D3.js and Plotly to visualize and explore the microbial species (OTUs) present in human navels. The dashboard includes a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and sample metadata to provide a comprehensive view of the dataset.

## Features

- **Horizontal Bar Chart:** Displaying the top 10 OTUs found in an individual, with sample values, OTU IDs, and hover text.

- **Bubble Chart:** Visualizing each sample with OTU IDs, sample values, marker size, marker colours, and text values.

## Instructions

- Open the index.html file in a web browser or visit https://github.com/zayanx7/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/index.html

- The default ID is set to 940. Use the dropdown menu to select a different ID and view the associated metadata, bar graph, and bubble chart.
